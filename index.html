                <p>In my adventures with fluid simulation, I came across something called the Fourier transform, a powerful algorithm used
                throughout many fields of science. Having no idea how it worked I took a step back. In this article, I will explain the
                realizations that have helped me understand the Fourier transform, and we'll use it to create a drawing program!

                <p>I've been interested for some time in the processes that can be used to visually
                simulate fluids for some time now. In this post, I hope to explore my struggles and success
                during my journey into the large and complex world of fluid simulation.

                <p>Recently, I took part in my state's FBLA competition, in the game design category.
                This year's theme was to make a word inspired game. While my experience in game development
                is limited, I managed to use my programming skills to create what I think, is a fun and
                challenging word puzzle game, similar to the likes of Wordle.

                <p>In fall of 2019, I started to learn C++. How? Through a large project in a
                field I had no experience in. Needless to say, I was in over my head.
