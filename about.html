<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content: space-between;">
  <div style="display:block;width:calc(65% - 2em);">
    <p>My name is James Dadabo, I have been programming as a hobby for almost a decade now.
      I first learned to code in third grade, in which I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javacript.
      Since then, I've learned a few more languages, with a new affinity for C++, and have worked on
      a multitude of projects to hone my skills.
    </p>

    <p>I am attending the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the fall majoring in computer science.
      While I don't know exactly what I want to do, I want to dive into the most technical aspects of CS that
      I can, and I am thrilled to do it in university.

<h3>Why this blog?</h3>
<p>In short, because I don't have the skills to make quality YouTube videos yet.</p>

<p>When I was in third grade, I made my first <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamesCubes-ne2iq">YouTube
    channel</a>.
  I taught people how to solve Rubik's cubes, and how to code using Processing. The production quality was never
  very high, and even with other YouTube channels in the future, I never quite attained the quality that I wanted.
  In the future, I'd like to try again, but I've built this blog to improve my skills, and create quality posts
  about topics I learn about.</p>
