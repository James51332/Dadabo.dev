<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content: space-between;">
  <div style="display:block;width:calc(65% - 2em);">
    <p>My name is James Dadabo, and I'm currently studying computer science at the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison. I am also proud to be a 2024 Amazon Future Engineer! As I look toward this summer, 
      I am thrilled to get to work with a team of like-minded student on projects with global impact.
    </p>  
    
    <p>I have been programming as a hobby for almost a decade now.
      When I first started to code in third grade, I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javacript.
      Since then, I've acquired a handful of other languages, and a particular affinity for C++. 
      My portfolio consists of quite a few different projects, but my 
      <a href="https://github.com/James51332/OceanSimulation">ocean simulation</a> is my favorite! 
      To learn more about it, as well as my other projects, check out my

<h3>Why this blog?</h3>
<p>In short, because I don't have the skills to make quality YouTube videos yet.</p>

<p>When I was in third grade, I made my first <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamesCubes-ne2iq">YouTube
    channel</a>.
  I taught people how to solve Rubik's cubes, and how to code using Processing. The production quality was never
  very high, and even with other YouTube channels in the future, I never quite attained the quality that I wanted.
  In the future, I'd like to try again, but I've built this blog to improve my skills, and create quality posts
  about topics I learn about.</p>
