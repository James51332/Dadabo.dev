                    <p>My name is James Dadabo, I have been programming as a hobby for almost a decade now.
                        I first learned to code in third grade, in which I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javacript.
                        Since then, I've learned a few more languages ranging from Java to C++, and have worked on
                        a multitude of projects to hone my skills.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>I am attending the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the fall majoring in computer science.
                        While I don't know exactly what I want to do, I want to dive into the most technical aspects of CS that
                        I can, and I am thrilled to do it in university.
                    </p>

            <h3>Why this blog?</h3>
            <p>In short, because I don't have the skills to make quality YouTube videos yet.</p>

            <p>When I was in third grade, I made my first <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamesCubes-ne2iq">YouTube channel</a>. 
                I taught people how to solve Rubik's cubes, and how to code using Processing. The production quality was never
                very high, and even with other YouTube channels in the future, I never quite attained the quality that I wanted.
                In the future, I'd like to try again, but I've built this blog to improve my skills, and create quality posts
                about topics I learn about.</p>
